        <h1>What is a Pet</h1>
        <div class="summary"> 
            <p>A pet, or companion animal, is an animal kept primarily for a person's company or entertainment rather than as a working animal, livestock or a laboratory animal. 
              Popular pets are often considered to have attractive appearances, intelligence and relatable personalities.
              People most commonly get pets for companionship, to protect a home or property or because of the perceived beauty or attractiveness of the animals.
            </p>
            <p>Two of the most popular pets are dogs and cats; the technical term for a cat lover is an ailurophile and a dog lover a cynophile. </p>
