        <h1>Pet History</h1>
        <h2>Prehistory</h2>
        <div class="summary">
            <p>Archaeology suggests that human ownership of dogs as pets may date back to at least 12,000 years ago.</p>

        <h2>Ancient history</h2>
        <div class="summary">
            <p>Ancient Greeks and Romans would openly grieve for the loss of a dog, evidenced by inscriptions left on tombstones commemorating their loss.
                The surviving epitaphs dedicated to horses are more likely to reference a gratitude for the companionship that had come from war horses rather than race horses. 
                The latter may have chiefly been commemorated as a way to further the owner's fame and glory.
                In Ancient Egypt, dogs and baboons were kept as pets and buried with their owners. Dogs were given names, which is significant as Egyptians considered names to have magical properties.

        <h2>Social</h2>
        <div class="summary">
            <p>Pets and animals also had social and cultural implications throughout the nineteenth century. 
                The categorization of dogs by their breeds reflected the hierarchical, social order of the Victorian era. The pedigree of a dog represented the high status and lineage of their owners and reinforced social stratification.
                The ability to care for a pet signified respectability and the capability to be self-sufficient. According to Harriet Ritvo, the identification of elite animal and elite owner was not a confirmation of the owners status but a way of redefining it.

        <h2>Entertainment</h2>
        <div class="summary">
            <p>
                The popularity of dog and pet keeping generated animal fancy. Dog fanciers showed enthusiasm for owning pets, breeding dogs, and showing dogs in various shows. The first dog show took place on 28 June 1859 in Newcastle and focused mostly on sporting and hunting dogs.
                The Kennel Club was created in 1873 to ensure fairness and organization within dog shows. The development of the Stud Book by the Kennel Club defined policies, presented a national registry system of purebred dogs, and essentially institutionalized dog shows.
