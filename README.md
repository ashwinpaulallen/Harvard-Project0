Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

This is a simple webpage about Pets.
I have currenlty only described dogs and cats in this website.
There are Four pages, index.html(homepage), types.html, history.html and gallery.html
The types.html page uses the mobile resposive @media to not display the images in the page.
Except the gallery.html, all other pages use the style.css, which is generated using SASS.
The style.scss file is preseent in the css folder.
The gallery.html uses the bootstrap components to display the images in columns.
There are hyperlinks provided at he end of the page to navigate to other pages in the website.
