        <div class="summary">
            <p>While many people have kept many different species of animals in captivity over the course of human history, only a relative few have been kept long enough to be considered domesticated.
                Domesticated pets are most common. A domesticated animal is a species that has been made fit for a human environment by being consistently kept in captivity and selectively bred over a long enough period of time that it exhibits marked differences in behavior and appearance from its wild relatives.
            </p>
            <P>Two of the most popular pets are dogs and cats; the technical term for a cat lover is an ailurophile and a dog lover a cynophile.</P>

                        The dog was the first species to be domesticated, and has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.
                        Their long association with humans has led dogs to be uniquely attuned to human behavior.
                        Unlike other domestic species which were primarily selected for production-related traits, dogs were initially selected for their behaviors.
                        They perform many roles for humans, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and military, companionship and, more recently, aiding disabled people and therapeutic roles. This influence on human society has given them the sobriquet of "man's best friend".

                        The cat is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal.
                        It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and is often referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish it from the wild members of the family.
                        A cat can either be a house cat, a farm cat or a feral cat; the latter ranges freely and avoids human contact.
                        Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and their ability to hunt pests such as rodents.
                        it has a strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth and retractable claws adapted to killing small prey. Its night vision and sense of smell are well developed. Cat communication includes vocalizations like meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling and grunting as well as cat-specific body language.
                        It is a solitary hunter but a social species.
